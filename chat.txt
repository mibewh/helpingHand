1. When a user expresses interest in a worker and worker accepts this, allow chat initiation (both can start it?)
2. Assign the users an unused chat room number, if a live chat (?)
3. Chat is realtime, but will also save messages. It would have to, just in case both are not on at the same time (db entries for messages?)
4. Standard IM features. Sending messages, receiving, display username beside message
5. Show whether the other user is typing or not.
6. Display chat window in a separate webpage or a popup window?
7. Unassign the room number so the number can be reused (integer overflow is probably a thing, though probably won't be experienced in this demo)
