Matching criteria:
	Schedule compatibility
	Rating for request's tag
		Rating becomes more important with more contracts completed
	Mix of newbs and vets (unsure how)

1. Submit a service request (no workers selected)
2. Pass parameters to worker recommender
3. Use weight function to sort the list of potential workers
	Apply slight element of randomness
4. Return list

Suggested schedule compatibility function:
compatibility = 0
 for every time slot where both the worker and client are free
  compatibility += 1;
 for every other client time slot
  compatiblity += 1/(time difference to nearest worker time slow + 1);

Suggested job type matching function:
 ??
 somehow use rating information of contracts of a particular job type to determine
 make sure noobs don't get left out because of fewer complete jobs
